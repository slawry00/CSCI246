## Discussions and Questions

Group discussions, questions, and announcements will be through [Piazza](piazza.com/montana/fall2018/csci246/home).

## Course Outcomes and Objectives
By the end of this course, a student will:

- Be able to use formal proof techniques, including mathematical induction and proof by contradiction.
- Understand algorithmic complexity and be able to use it to compare different program designs for a problem.
- Solve problems that use logic, sets, and functions.
- Solve problems using Boolean algebra.
- Solve problems that use permutations and combinations.
- Solve problems that use discrete probability.
- Solve problems that use basic graph theory.

## Grading
Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- 5% Attendance 
- 30% Homework
- 10% Online Quizzes 
- 20% Midterm I
- 20% Midterm II
- 15% Final 

A grade above an 90 will earn at least an A-, above a 80 will earn at least a 
B-, above 70 will earn at leat a C-, and above 60 will earn at least D-.

### Policy on Class Attendance

Class attendance and participation is required.  Attendance will be randomly
taken throughout the semester.

### Policy on Homework 

All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on the due date. Late
assignments will not be accepted.

Throughout this semester, we will have 12 homework assignments.  The best 10 grades
will count towards the homework grade.

For descriptive assignments and reports, the submission should be typeset
(preferably in LaTex), and
submitted as a PDF both in D2L and [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). Each problem should be started on a fresh page.
* Code to sign up for [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com): M8NJY5

For code assignments,
well organized source code with clear comments should be submitted.

## Policy on Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged on all aspects of the class, except where explicitly 
forbidden. Note:

- All collaboration (who and what) must be clearly indicated in writing on 
anything turned in.  
- Homework may be solved collaboratively except as explicitly forbidden, 
but solutions must be written up **independently**. 
This is best done by writing your solutions when not in a group setting.
Groups should be small 
enough that each member plays a significant role.

## Policy on Academic Integrity

The integrity of the academic process requires that credit be given where credit
is due. Accordingly, it is academic misconduct to present the ideas or works of
another as one's own work, or to permit another to present one's work without
customary and proper acknowledgment of authorship. Students may collaborate with
other students only as expressly permitted by the instructor. Students are
responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, the
appropriate citation of sources and the respect and recognition of others'
academic endeavors.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. According to the Meriam-Webster
dictionary, plagiarism is `the act of using another person's words or ideas
without giving credit to that person.'  Proper credit means describing all
outside resources (conversations, websites, etc.), and explaining the extent to
which the resource was used.  Penalties for plagiarism at MSU include (but are
not limited to) failing the assignment, failing the class, or having your degree
revoked.  This is serious, so do not plagiarize.
Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work
(such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged)
is considered plagiarism. 

By participating in this class, you agree to abide by the Student Code of
Conduct.  This includes the following academic expectations:

- be prompt and regular in attending classes;
- be well-prepared for classes;
- submit required assignments in a timely manner;
- take exams when scheduled, unless rescheduled under 310.01;
- act in a respectful manner toward other students and the instructor and in a way
          that does not detract from the learning experience; and
- make and keep appointments when necessary to meet with the instructor. 

## Classroom Etiquette

Except for note taking and group work requiring a computer, please keep electronic devices off during
class, as they can be distractions to other students. Disruptions to the class will
result in being asked to leave the lecture, and one half-point will be deducted
from the attendance grade.

## Withdrawing

After 20 October 2018, I will only support requests to withdraw from this course
with a ``W" grade if extraordinary personal circumstances exist.
If you are considering withdrawing from this class, discussing this with me as 
early as possible is advised.  Since this class involves a project, the 
decision to withdraw must be discussed with me, and with your group.

## Special needs information

If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation(s), please contact me and Disabled
Student Services within the first two weeks of class.
